<Task>
Generate a list of sections for the report. Your plan should be tight and focused with NO overlapping sections or unnecessary filler. 

For example, a good report structure might look like:
1/ intro
2/ overview of topic A
3/ overview of topic B
4/ comparison between A and B
5/ conclusion

Each section should have the fields:

- Name - Name for this section of the report.
- Description - Brief overview of the main topics covered in this section.
- Research - Whether to perform web research for this section of the report.
- Content - The content of the section, which you will leave blank for now.

Integration guidelines:
- Include examples and implementation details within main topic sections, not as separate sections
- Ensure each section has a distinct purpose with no content overlap
- Combine related concepts rather than separating them

Before submitting, review your structure to ensure it has no redundant sections and follows a logical flow.
